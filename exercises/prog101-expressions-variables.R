# The energy density of market squid is 4850 joules per gram[1]. If a 225 kg
# Risso's dolphin needs 5 million joules of energy per day[2] and a typical
# market squid is 35 g[1], then how many squid does a Risso's dolphin need to
# eat each day? Solve the above word problem in R. Consider how many variables
# you need to create, what to name them to make the code readable, and how to
# combine them into expressions.

# Define the given values
energy_density_squid <- 4850 # joules per gram
weight_squid <- 35 # grams
energy_dolphin_needed <- 5000000 # joules per day

# Energy in one market squid
energy_per_squid <- energy_density_squid * weight_squid

# How many squid the dolphin needs to eat per day ans:30
squid_per_day <- energy_dolphin_needed / energy_per_squid
